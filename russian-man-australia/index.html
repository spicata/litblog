      <p><em>To your potential disappointment, the Russian man is (sadly) <strong>not</strong> Rasputin.</em></p>
<p><img src="/love.png" alt="my favourite sww poem" /></p>
<p>As a really brief summary, when read literally, “for the wake and skeleton dance” is about a wake held for ‘dreamtime Dostoyevskys’. However, as with all of Watson’s poetry, there is more to it than what is just on the page. So let’s dive right into it...</p>
<p>The poem opens with the line “the dreamtime Dostoyeskys murmur of a recession in the spirit world”. Just from reading this line, we might already have a few questions. Who is Dostoyevsky? Why is he talking about a recession?</p>
<p><img src="/economy.png" alt="dostoyevsky vs economy" /></p>
<p>And these are good questions — ones I will talk about later — but past that, this first line establishes a certain mood of dread. After all, whoever Dostoyevsky is, him murmuring about a recession can't possibly be good news, right?</p>
<p>But by following that with the “night creatures are feeling the pinch / of growing disbelief and western rationality”, we can already infer that this is about the conflict between Western culture and Indigenous Australian culture, and the loss of the latter.</p>
<h2 id="the-loss-of-indigenous-culture">the loss of indigenous culture</h2>
<p>A large portion of Indigenous culture has been lost throughout the years because of Western colonisation and rule. And “for the wake and skeleton dance” both represents this, but also reflects on it with a solemn tone.</p>
<p>A recession is a period of economic downturn. And so, the lexical choice of ‘recession’ in the first line brings with it an idea of the waning of Indigenous culture, thus weakening the ‘spirit world’; a concept quite significant to Indigenous spirituality.</p>
<p>Similarly, the ‘night creatures’ is synecdochal of Indigenous culture, and it ‘feeling the pinch’ points towards the discontinuation or the corruption of said culture, even within Indigenous groups as it becomes replaced by ‘western rationality’.</p>
<p>Then there are also the ‘dreamtime Dostoyevskys’, which is a recurring phrase throughout the entire poem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the dreamtime Dostoyevskys murmur of a recession in the spirit world<br />
the dreamtime Dostoyevskys ponder<br />
the dreamtime Dostoyevskys feel the early winter</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/iseehim.png" alt="i see dostoyevsky" /></p>
<p>Importantly, Dreamtime is lowercase in all of these recurrences despite being a proper noun. The effect is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proper nouns always start with an uppercase to indicate its difference from common nouns. The use of the lower case in ‘dreamtime’ reveals the normalcy of the Dreamtime from Watson’s Indigenous point of view. Contrastingly, Dostoyevsky who can be seen as metonymy for Western culture and influence is capitalised, emphasising it as external and alien, not fitting but still being forced into — and in turn suppressing — Indigenous Australian culture. </li>
<li>Proper nouns always start with an uppercase to indicate its importance. Something that's not important or viewed as unimportant isn’t capitalised. ‘dreamtime’ shows the devaluation of the Indigenous spirituality within modern Australian society; the society instead enshrines Western ideology, which can further also be seen in the capitalisation of ‘the Covenant’ later in the poem.</li>
</ol>
<p>But still...</p>
<h2 id="who-on-earth-is-dostoyevsky">who on earth is dostoyevsky?</h2>
<p><img src="/bonjour.png" alt="hi dostoyevsky!" /></p>
<p><em>tl;dr</em>: Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was a highly influential Russian writer. Often said to be a writer who gave voice to the anonymous or underground, whose literary works had strong links to self and spirituality.</p>
<p><strong>In his youth.</strong> </p>
<p>His works gave voice to the anonymous in his youth. During this time, he was a largely progressive writer and was a member of the Petrashevsky Circle; an (illegal) literary discussion group that would sometimes discuss works that were banned in the Russian Empire for being critical of the Tsarist regime. </p>
<p>In fact, his involvement here would get him into a close shave with death, as the entire group was set up for execution. </p>
<p>Luckily for Dostoyevsky, this was all a ruse by the Tsar. The execution was 'called off', and they were set to Siberia for detainment instead. Dostoevsky later wrote that the “head that created, lived the higher life of art… had already been cut from his shoulders” in regards to this mock execution.</p>
<p>However, after his return from Siberia, he had become a staunch monarchist. He adopted the belief that the Tsarist government was the absolute form of government, believing that both democracy and constitution were flawed. </p>
<p>Though, even after this radical change, he still “didn’t want to obey the etiquette of the court”.</p>
<p>Many of his works would include themes of suicide, poverty, human manipulation and morality. Notable examples include: Poor Folks, Crime and Punishment, and The Brother Karamazov.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-he-doing-in-wagon-s-poetry">what is he doing in wagon’s poetry?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, Dostoyevsky was a voice for the silent and marginalised, as his texts would often depict the struggles and hardships of normal people during times of economic, social, and political tumult.</p>
<p>The ‘dreamtime Dostoyevskys’ are those who are most intimately connected to Indigenous culture and those who can act as the voices of Indigenous people; they are the Elders within Indigenous socities.</p>
<p>Throughout the poem, they are the first to hear of news, to notice changes in the weather, and those who think most deeply.
The final lines read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the wake is over<br />
…<br />
and retirement eternal for the dreamtime Dostoyevsky</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ‘retirement eternal’ is a euphemism for death. And through that, Watson sets this particular line different from the rest. Unlike the earlier lines that were focused on the decline and extinction of Indigenous cultures, this last line reveals the very human aspect to this decline: it reflects the death of those who guard and champion it.</p>
<p>Even the specific wording of ‘dreamtime Dostoyevsky’ differs, as this one is singular. It is the death of the last dreamtime Dostoyevsky, and with it it brings a fear of the finality of this decline.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, it seems that “for the wake and skeleton dance” is an elegy lamenting the perceived decline of Indigenous culture within modern Australian society. However, it is not too late; Indigenous culture seems to be in a resurgance lately, and proposal such as the Voice Referendum (despite failing) highlights that Australian society is at a point where these issues regarding Indigenous Australian autonomy and recognition can be discussed. Which hopefully means that action is soon to come...</p>
<p>and that we’ll be able to avoid the fate of the <strong>dreamtime Dostoyevskys</strong>.</p>
